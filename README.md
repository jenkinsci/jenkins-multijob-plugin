## When to use MultiJob (tikal-multijob-plugin) plugin ?
- If you'd like to stop the mess with downstream / upstream jobs chains definitions
- When you want to add full hierarchy of Jenkins jobs that will be executed in sequence or in parallel
- Add context to your buildflow implementing parameter inheritance from the MultiJob to all its Phases and Jobs, Phases are sequential whilst jobs inside each Phase are parallel
