<div>
    <b>This condition is only used if 'Resume skip expression' in 'Resume skip condition' option is specified.</b><br>
    Add very simple and basic condition to run this job. Write a condition in groovy script format. You can use environment variable. If the expression cannot be evaluate, false is assumed.<br />
    <br />
    Example : ${BUILDNUMBER} % 2 == 1 for running this job every two times or if you have a string parameter you cas use "${Name}" == "Myjob".
