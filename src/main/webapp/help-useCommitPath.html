  	If checked, patterns defined in phase jobs of the MultiJob will be considered when determining which jobs to be executed.
	<br/>
	This is only valid if ALL paths in a commit are covered by patterns.
	<br/>
	Example, a commit affects paths:
	<pre>
	project1/src/integTest/java/com/acme/test/TestOne.java
	project2/src/integTest/java/com/acme/test/TestSomethingElse.java</pre>
	Say we have a large number of sub jobs but the paths above are only affecting one phase job each. Then there is no need to execute the others.
	<br/>
	Define regex patterns in the commit path field for the two jobs:
	<pre>
	Job-One: "project1/src/integTest/java/.*"
	Job-Two: "project2/src/integTest/java/.*"</pre>
	- and only the jobs Job-One and Job-Two will be executed.
	<br/>
	If another change (project1/src/main/java/com/acme/product/Main.java) would be present that is not covered in a phase job config,
	then ALL jobs will be executed for the whole change set.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	A path may be present in more than one job.
