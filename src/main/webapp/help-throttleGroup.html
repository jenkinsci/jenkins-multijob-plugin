<div>
	A throttle group restricts which jobs can run in parallel.  All jobs with identical
	throttle groups will run in series rather than parallel.

	<p>
	By default, all jobs within a phase run in parallel.  So if you have jobs A, B, and C -
	they will all execute in parallel.  This looks like:
	<pre>
  A......
  B........
  C...
  </pre>

	<p>
	With throttle groups, you can assign the same string to jobs A and C.  This will cause
	C to wait until A finishes executing before it starts.  This would look like:
	<pre>
  A......
  B........
         C...
  </pre>
</div>
